## Dependencies

You just need a recent version of node.js (a v12.x should be ok).

## How to use

Create a `dist/` repository and launch the following command :

`node index`

Il will automatically generate the svg in the `dist/` directory.

## What do I see ?

The solar system with a logarithmic scale for the distance from the sun. Neither the sun nor the planets radius is at the scale.
